            <p>A savory pork dish perfect for summer!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>  1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>  2 pork chops</li>
            <li>  salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>  ½ lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>  ¼ onion, sliced</li>
            <li>  ½ cup Korean soju </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil and butter in a skillet over high heat. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper, then place in the skillet in the hot oil; cook until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove pork chops from the skillet, and set aside. Add the sliced onion to the skillet; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and soju, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Simmer until liquid as reduced, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and drizzle the sauce over the pork chops for serving.</li>
